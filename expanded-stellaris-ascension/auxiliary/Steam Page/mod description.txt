[b]Featured in Odin Gamings top 10 Stellaris Mods of 2017![/b]

[h1]Intro[/h1]
This mod adds 45 new Ascension Perks to the game. Designate your planets as Forge Worlds our garden worlds, find new mineral deposits and unlock special rare technologies to be discovered.

I have tried to keep away from "Boring" stuff (like +5 Starbase Capacity). There are still a few perks like that, but I have tried to make things as fun as possible. A lot of the perks have more to them than what is written in the description (It would have become far too long!). I will upload a list with detailed descriptions among the discussions where you can check closer what each perk do (in addition to a list with a shorter description of each perk).

[h1]Example Perks[/h1]
[list]
[*] Deep Core Mining: Lets you discover new mineral deposits on a planet, but reduces its happiness and habitability.
[*] Forge Worlds [Hive Minds Only]: Let's you designate a planet as a forge world, increasing production capabilities while giving other penalties.
[*] Ultimate Ascension & Perfect Ascension: Unlocks the ability to combine the perks from the various ascension paths (including one new tier 2 perk added to each path).[/list]

[h1]Important Information - Please Read[/h1]
[list]
[*] The full list of perks and their effect can be found on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1067631798/1457328927842758060/]this description page[/url].
[*] Please read the "Providing Bug Reports" section before providing a bug report.
[*] Certain perks have passive negative effects on other empires (like penalties to rivals). The AI does not use them, but you can make it use them using an option in the "common/scrippted_triggers/est_options.txt" file.
[*] Please provide feedback and bug reports for my tradition perk mod at [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=946222466&tscn=1631885041]that mod's page[/url].[/list]

[h1]Expanded Stellaris Traditions[/h1]
Check out my other mod, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=946222466]Expanded Stellaris Traditions[/url] which adds 44 new Tradition Trees to the game!

[b]Features:[/b]
[list]
[*] 44 new tradition trees added.
[*] Extensive use of tradition swapping. 
[list]
[*] Playing a hive-mind, or an authoritarian dictatorship? In that case, liberal democracy style traditions will be swapped out for more fitting stuff (what exactly depends on what you play).
[*] Not using Robots? Traditions giving bonuses to robots will give different bonuses. Same things for slavery, megastructures etc.
[*] Theme changing with your empire. The Order tree will be very different for a Slaving Autocracy and an Egalitan empire.[/list]
[*] Built-in AI support. Either the AI is able to use a tradition properly, or they will have an easier-to-use swap giving a corresponding bonus.
[*] Traditions do not only contains passive bonuses, more interesting effects, such as:
[list]
[*] Bonuses depending on your playstyle, conditioned on fulfilling special conditions. 
[*] Adding new buildings, edicts, jobs, policies, technologies, traits, etc.
[*] Gain resources for destroying enemy ships, raid neighbouring empires, pick virtues for your leaders, and much more interesting stuff.[/list]
[*] Unique icons, tree layouts, and well-written flavour texts for all traditions.
[*] Full compatibility with other mods.[/list]

[h1]Providing Bug Reports[/h1]
Please report all bugs that you find. However, it would be very helpful if you could follow these steps to make it easier for me to fix the bug:
[list]
[*]Please report your bugs [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1067631798/1457328927847712765/]at this discussion page[/url]. I can't always fix bugs as they are reported, and if you only report them in the main discussion they very easily get swamped by other comments by the time I can look at them.
[*] Please describe what is the problem. "X doesn't work" is not very helpful.
[*] Please provide a screenshot, it is very helpful.
[*] Please try and confirm whenever the bug persists with only this mod present.[/list]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This is compatible with everything that does not modify the vanilla ascension perk file. The reason for me modifying this file is to allow people to combine the various ascension paths (through the Ultimate and Perfect Ascension Ascension Perks). If there is much demand for a compatibility patch with certain mods I can make that. If you use this mod as well as many other mods, you probably should use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1688887083]this mod[/url].[/list]

[h1]Giving Input[/h1]
The vast majority of all playthroughs with this mod are not done by me, to make it as good as possible I need all the input I can get. Please come with any input that you have, a large amount of the input I receive actually have real input on this mod. Please note that there are appropriate pages at [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/discussions/1067631798]the discussions tab of this mod[/url] for each type of input.
[list]
[*] [b]Balance:[/b] While top priority has been to come up with interesting themes for all perks I do believe this is not incompatible with having a balanced mod. All input on which perks you find too strong to weak is appreciated.
[*] [b]Bugs:[/b] I test everything that I upload. However, this mod gets quite complex and in certain cases, there might be a bug. There is also a lot of stuff in it so I've probably missed a few things as well. Right now it should be quite solid, with the next update there might be a few new ones though. Please report!
[*] [b]Spelling:[/b] English is not my first language (however I try to check everything with a spell checker). If you find some error, tell me and I will fix it.
[*] [b]Suggestions:[/b] Have any cool ideas for new perks? I am open to suggestions. No promises but if you have something I will think about it at least.
[*] [b]Themes:[/b] Do you like the themes of the perks? Are there any one of them that you don't think is clear enough? I think the RP part is important, so please come with any input you have on this. Maybe you have an idea for a more fitting name for a tree or tradition?[/list]
